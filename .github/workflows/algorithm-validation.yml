# Algorithm Portfolio Validation & Quality Gates
#
# This workflow ensures that every PR to main and every push to main
# contains all 34 algorithms defined in ALGORITHM_MANIFEST.json.
#
# It runs BEFORE quality gates (tests, mypy, ruff) because there is
# no point running 800 tests if 2 algorithms are missing.
#
# This workflow was created to prevent the recurrence of missed algorithms
# during branch consolidation merges (root cause: Observer's Paradox,
# Overlap Masking, and No Whole-Portfolio Validation).
